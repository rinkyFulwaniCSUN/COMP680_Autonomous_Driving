You can use google colab for this project which might be easier for quick execution as you do not have to wrry about installing the dependencies.
Or you can clone this repository on your system and set up the tensorflow GPU to execute this.

Note: Training and execution time will vary acccording to your system specifications


The saved model folder contains the checkpoint and the trained model file
The trained model file is the saved_model.pb file and the checkpoint files are under the variables folder.

You have to feed the trained model into the video_detection.ipynb file and this model will be applied on the video that you will upload

The video that we have used for this project has been uploaded and the final output is also uploaded.

The training of the model is done on model_trainin.ipynb code.

When you open the .ipynb files you will be able to see the execution sequence and the execution results are saved there.
