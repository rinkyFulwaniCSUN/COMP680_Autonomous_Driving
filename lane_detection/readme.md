Goals:

Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.



To execute the lane detection module you will have to clone the repository and make sure that you are in the folder where you clone the repository.

You have to execute the code here and you will be able to see the output simultaneously.

The best IDE to use for this is spyder or you can use VSCode as well.

I have used Spyder for this project.

The final output is stored in the img folder by the name overview.gif.

We have also uploaded the video that we have used for this project.
